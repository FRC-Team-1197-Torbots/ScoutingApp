# ScoutingApp
2017 Scouting Application for Team 1197 Torbots

# Purpose
The purpose of this application is to provide a more effective platform for gathering scouting data.

# Instructions
The project might not find the LWJGL2 library at first.  I have included it at the top level of the git folder.  
Simply include those JARs in the build path.  There are also two DLLs incase.  You sholdn't have to do anything
with those files to make it work.  The actual test project is ControllerTest.
